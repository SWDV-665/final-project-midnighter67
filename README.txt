This app is incomplete.  In fact, it doesn't do anything useful.  It was much more difficult than I expected.  I tried to implement a user auth but gave up on it.  I remove it so the app would not fail with errors.  The Google maps piece is partially functional in that it displays the map and pins for parking and generates a list but parking is not selectable or payable by mobile and I don't have a way to add to the history page.  I put some stuff in the database manually so the history tab would populate with something.  The account page has links for sign up or login and an alert popup for entering info but I didn't know what to do with the information.  I could've just added it to a json file or another database but I chose to spend more time to get the maps part working.  This project was much more difficult than I expected.
